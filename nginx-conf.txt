This file contains configuration info for the nginx.conf file in the server used to set up the reverse proxy. 

# Controls how many parallel processes nginx spawns to handle client requests
# Instead of using a new process for any incoming connection, nginx uses worker processes that handle many connections using a single-threaded event loop 
# In production, worker_processes should be set to the number of CPU cores of the server where nginx is running to take advantage of parallel processing
worker_processes 1;

# Defines how many simultaneous connections each worker process can handle
# More connections -> more memory used
events {
	worker_connections 1024;
}


# Defines how to handle http requests for a particular domain or IP address -> how to listen for connections, which domain the configuration applies to, and how to route the requests

	# Also Define logic for which server to send the request to; default is round robin
